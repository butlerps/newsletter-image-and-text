# newsletter-image-and-text
A block for the Wordpress Newsletter Plugin that allows for the placement of images and html text side by side.  The code generated by the block is responsive in that on small view screens the image & text become stacked instead of side by side.

upload the image-text folder to /wp-content/plugins/newsletter/emails/blocks
